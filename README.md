To start the server run `server\server.js`:
```cmd
> node server\server.js
```
Then you can open a couple of browser tabs on `http://localhost:3000` and type some messages.
- The sent messages will appear in all tabs.
- The connected users (browser tabs) are shown in the **Online** bar.
- If a user is typing it will be shown in the bar right below **Online** bar.

There is no need to provide `.env` file.
